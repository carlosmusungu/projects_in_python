    - 06:54: The non-meat subgroups consumed considerably less dietary cholesterol (30-60% less) than the meat-consuming subgroups.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6AD2llpgw
    - 06:54: This difference in dietary cholesterol intake likely accounts for the slight variations observed in blood cholesterol and LDL levels. [AI KNOWLEDGE]({}),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6AD2llpgw
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6AD2llpgw
- 07:34: Dr. Norton's Interpretation of the Study,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6AD2llpgw
"    - 08:00: Maintaining calorie control and a balanced diet, even with higher saturated fat intake, might not necessarily elevate blood cholesterol.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6AD2llpgw
"    - 08:00: A low saturated fat diet is likely to lower LDL and blood cholesterol, even with red and white meat consumption.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6AD2llpgw
"    - 08:30: If concerned, controlling total cholesterol and saturated fat intake can produce results similar to those achieved with a meat-free diet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6AD2llpgw

    - 01:04:28: Norton states that TEF as a whole probably doesn't even make up 400 calories a day let alone the fact that protein is the most powerful uh macronutrient to affect TEF and even if you double protein you only get about 100 calories more per day of TEF so it just doesn't make sense there's there's.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:04:56: He states that he also did a metaanalysis where they basically it was a reanalysis of a a meta analysis that was done that basically said there's no difference in energy expenditure between low carb diets or high carb diets when protein and calories are matched I referenced it earlier as by Kevin Hall.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:05:29: Norton states that Kevin Hall's study suggested was the opposite he suggested there was actually an increase in energy expenditure small like 50 to 100 calories a day during the initial adaptation but what after about a week that went away.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk

    - 01:06:33: He explains that if it's longer than 17 days most of the studies on energy expenditure are going to be with doubly labeled water and not metabolic chamber because you can't House people for very long in a metabolic chamber because you have to pay them because you're basically keeping them in food jail.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk

- 01:07:28: Hormetic Stressor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:07:28: DeLauer states that to shed light on like why someone when they're first starting a low carb or keto diet might end up having an increase in their metabolic rate even just you know I think it ended up being refuted more to probably like 60 to 40 maybe versus I think a like 135 to 150 or something that was uh you know purported but it's generally comes from it's a it's a hormetic stressor.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:07:53: He explains that one of the things that I try to explain that is very important is that you know you you still want a level of efficiency to some point I think there's this like infat ation with inefficiency.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:08:15: DeLauer states that people think that inefficiency automatically means that you're magically incinerating calories Into Thin Air it's not necessarily the case I mean there's there's arguments with uncoupling proteins and with with ketones and uncoupling proteins the data is kind of all over the place and a lot of it you know it's um it's it's you know it's going to be in cultured cells so it's really difficult to look at right.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk

- 01:09:03: Fat Adapted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:09:03: DeLauer states that having to look at someone that is truly fat adapted and I know that's a term that's thrown around a lot but when you look at you know someone that has been doing keto for 6 months 12 months and you actually start to see uh some legitimate changes in terms of how their mitochondria utilize ketones or utilize you know fats um you know then that kind of that kind of tails off and you start to see okay it kind of comes back to a baseline efficiency and then at that rate it just simply does come down to what works best for you.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:09:26: He explains that keto worked for me when nothing else really would because I just I'm one of those guys that if I start having carbs I turn into a carb monster like I'm just one of those guys and meaning like I I get the taste of it and I I go for it so keto just worked well for me for that I'm long past the stages where I'm trying to like prevent weight regain.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:10:22: DeLauer states that people will send me stuff like you know mitochondrial on coupling and respiration and whatnot they'll say what do you think like this is you know this what I'm like yeah I mean that's totally possible but again remember if it's having a big impact on Fat Loss we're going to see that show up in actual fat loss right so that's why I think it's important for people to always remember that like yeah uncoupling proteins matter all this stuff matters but it's still going to show up and calories in calories out in one way or another.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
- 01:11:15: Keto and Glucose Intolerance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:11:15: DeLauer states that with with regards to the the initial bump in inefficiency part of it too may be also that you tend to eliminate more ketones in urine um initially and so you're losing some calories that way as well but yeah to me the argument that okay somehow at 17 days this magically flips that you actually burn more calories that seems weird and not really you don't really see that in other metabolic processes right.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk
    - 01:11:46: He explains that if you're going keto for an extended period of time there is a level of glucose intolerance that happens okay it's just your mitochondria your learns how to use a given substrate if you don't use it you lose it in a certain fashion and glucose intolerance can absolutely occur and it's one of the reasons why when people are keto for a very strict amount of time and then all of a sudden they they binge on a bunch of carbohydrates a bunch of refined starches they feel they feel extraordinarily bad you know and because you're literally running head first into a massive inefficiency and that's going to trigger heaven knows what right so but being able to sort of embrace that is one of the things that makes it awesome right we Embrace going to the gym and pushing ourselves against a stressor we Embrace periods of uh you know in my world fasting as a hormetic stressor uh even strategic gaps in between meals you know when you actually log your food and track your food and you don't eat uh for 3 hours or 4 hours after eating be surprised people think oh I'm eating six square meals a day okay well it's and I still lost weight yes absolutely but have you ever stopped to think that maybe because you're tracking and you're eating six very defined meals that you're not snacking in between those meals and that's a huge player and yeah they've actually shown that just structured regimented food intake regardless of like tracking will actually lower calorie intake so if you eat in a structured manner it actually lowers calorie intake typically that makes perfect sense and I guess my my words of wisdom for whatever they're worth are you know take these things that you see from these these models these studies and and do what you want with them but use them use them as motivation use them as inspiration for whatever you want to do I'd say I mean a lot of the content on my channel is there just to keep people going right people that are doing low carb they want to hear about this stuff because it gives them that that extra juice to keep it going and you know I I feel like that's the case for whatever you're doing you know if you're vegan you probably get your rocks off a little bit by finding a new study that looks like it rains on meat consumption right so if that's what keeps you going then that's okay just got to keep it in check too and I guess my point with the whole hormetic stressors and everything like that I mean that's just I'm into that stuff right I feel like maybe it's a little bit of I like torturing myself I like I like my ice baths I like saunas I like that stuff because it's a stressor and it feels good and I I can't help but feel like when you're up against some kind of stressor there is an adaptation that's going to occur um and that's a stressor on the body just in its very sense right so of course you're going to be up against some kind of adaptation or inefficiency that's going to temporarily increase metabolic rate for whatever reason doesn't mean it's going to stick forever it doesn't mean that if you go and you hit that sauna at 200° every single day that you're going to get the same effect every single day um and I think it's just important for people to know that it's not a none of this stuff is a magic pill it's just it's just,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXPKlxSXHk

    - 00:55: Late time-restricted feeding: Consuming meals from afternoon until 8:00 p.m.

- 01:21: Meta-Analysis: Overall Findings
    - 01:21: The meta-analysis revealed a reduction in HbA1c levels [AI KNOWLEDGE]({}), a measure of long-term blood sugar.
    - 01:21: Fasting glucose and fasting insulin didn't show significant changes overall.
    - 01:21: This supports the idea that time-restricted eating can help manage calorie intake and improve HbA1c.

- 01:52: Subgroup Analysis: Early vs. Late Feeding
    - 01:52: Early time-restricted feeding demonstrated more promising results in lowering fasting blood glucose.
    - 01:52: It also showed a slight advantage in reducing fasting blood insulin levels.

- 01:52: Questioning Long-Term Significance
    - 01:52: Is there a lasting impact from these early vs. late time-restricted feeding differences?
    - 02:19: HbA1c data did not show a statistically significant difference between the two feeding windows.

- 02:19: The Importance of HbA1c Measurement
    - 02:19: HbA1c provides a view of average blood glucose levels over roughly 120 days.
    - 02:19: It serves as a reliable indicator of long-term blood glucose management.

- 02:48: Explaining Fasting Glucose Variations
    - 02:48: Lower fasting glucose with early time-restricted feeding might be due to a longer fasting duration before measurement.
    - 03:18: Future studies should standardize measurement timing to account for these varying fasting periods.

- 03:47: Standardizing Glucose Measurements
    - 03:18: Measure glucose at comparable fasting durations for both early and late time-restricted feeding groups.
    - 04:15: Under similar postabsorptive conditions, blood glucose levels might show less divergence.

- 04:15: Hypothesis: Blood Glucose Fluctuations
    - 04:15: Late in the day, those on late time-restricted feeding might exhibit lower blood glucose compared to the early group.
    - 04:15: This is because the early time-restricted feeding group would have already consumed their meals for the day.

- 04:39: Key Takeaway: Prioritize Adherence
    - 04:39: Time-restricted feeding is an effective strategy for calorie management.
    - 04:39: Choose a feeding window that fits your lifestyle to maximize adherence and long-term success.

    - 05:08: Enjoy a substantial breakfast? Early time-restricted feeding might be a great fit.
    - 05:08: Prefer eating later in the day? Late time-restricted feeding could be the better choice.

- 05:30: The Power of Research Analysis

,"- 00:00: Unpacking Time-Restricted Feeding & Chrononutrition
    - 00:00: Diving into a new meta-analysis exploring time-restricted eating.
    - 00:00: Examining its impact on key markers: HbA1c, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose levels.

- 00:30: Time-Restricted Eating: The Study Design
    - 00:30: Comparing time-restricted eating to control diets, without calorie matching.
    - 00:30: Investigating the effects of early versus late time-restricted feeding schedules.

- 00:55: Defining Early vs. Late Feeding Windows
    - 00:55: Early time-restricted feeding: Eating between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
    - 00:55: Late time-restricted feeding: Consuming meals from afternoon until 8:00 p.m.

- 01:21: Meta-Analysis: Overall Findings
    - 01:21: The meta-analysis revealed a reduction in HbA1c levels [AI KNOWLEDGE]({}), a measure of long-term blood sugar.
    - 01:21: Fasting glucose and fasting insulin didn't show significant changes overall.
    - 01:21: This supports the idea that time-restricted eating can help manage calorie intake and improve HbA1c.

- 01:52: Subgroup Analysis: Early vs. Late Feeding
    - 01:52: Early time-restricted feeding demonstrated more promising results in lowering fasting blood glucose.
    - 01:52: It also showed a slight advantage in reducing fasting blood insulin levels.

- 01:52: Questioning Long-Term Significance
    - 01:52: Is there a lasting impact from these early vs. late time-restricted feeding differences?
    - 02:19: HbA1c data did not show a statistically significant difference between the two feeding windows.

- 02:19: The Importance of HbA1c Measurement
    - 02:19: HbA1c provides a view of average blood glucose levels over roughly 120 days.
    - 02:19: It serves as a reliable indicator of long-term blood glucose management.

- 02:48: Explaining Fasting Glucose Variations
    - 02:48: Lower fasting glucose with early time-restricted feeding might be due to a longer fasting duration before measurement.
    - 03:18: Future studies should standardize measurement timing to account for these varying fasting periods.

- 03:47: Standardizing Glucose Measurements
    - 03:18: Measure glucose at comparable fasting durations for both early and late time-restricted feeding groups.
    - 04:15: Under similar postabsorptive conditions, blood glucose levels might show less divergence.

- 04:15: Hypothesis: Blood Glucose Fluctuations
    - 04:15: Late in the day, those on late time-restricted feeding might exhibit lower blood glucose compared to the early group.
    - 04:15: This is because the early time-restricted feeding group would have already consumed their meals for the day.

- 04:39: Key Takeaway: Prioritize Adherence
    - 04:39: Time-restricted feeding is an effective strategy for calorie management.
    - 04:39: Choose a feeding window that fits your lifestyle to maximize adherence and long-term success.

    - 00:55: Early time-restricted feeding: Eating between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
    - 00:55: Late time-restricted feeding: Consuming meals from afternoon until 8:00 p.m.

- 01:21: Meta-Analysis: Overall Findings
    - 01:21: The meta-analysis revealed a reduction in HbA1c levels [AI KNOWLEDGE]({}), a measure of long-term blood sugar.
    - 01:21: Fasting glucose and fasting insulin didn't show significant changes overall.
    - 01:21: This supports the idea that time-restricted eating can help manage calorie intake and improve HbA1c.

- 01:52: Subgroup Analysis: Early vs. Late Feeding
    - 01:52: Early time-restricted feeding demonstrated more promising results in lowering fasting blood glucose.
    - 01:52: It also showed a slight advantage in reducing fasting blood insulin levels.

- 01:52: Questioning Long-Term Significance
    - 01:52: Is there a lasting impact from these early vs. late time-restricted feeding differences?
    - 02:19: HbA1c data did not show a statistically significant difference between the two feeding windows.

- 02:19: The Importance of HbA1c Measurement
    - 02:19: HbA1c provides a view of average blood glucose levels over roughly 120 days.
    - 02:19: It serves as a reliable indicator of long-term blood glucose management.

- 02:48: Explaining Fasting Glucose Variations
    - 02:48: Lower fasting glucose with early time-restricted feeding might be due to a longer fasting duration before measurement.
    - 03:18: Future studies should standardize measurement timing to account for these varying fasting periods.

- 03:47: Standardizing Glucose Measurements
    - 03:18: Measure glucose at comparable fasting durations for both early and late time-restricted feeding groups.
    - 04:15: Under similar postabsorptive conditions, blood glucose levels might show less divergence.

- 04:15: Hypothesis: Blood Glucose Fluctuations
    - 04:15: Late in the day, those on late time-restricted feeding might exhibit lower blood glucose compared to the early group.
    - 04:15: This is because the early time-restricted feeding group would have already consumed their meals for the day.

- 04:39: Key Takeaway: Prioritize Adherence
    - 04:39: Time-restricted feeding is an effective strategy for calorie management.

- 00:30: Time-Restricted Eating: The Study Design
    - 00:30: Comparing time-restricted eating to control diets, without calorie matching.
    - 00:30: Investigating the effects of early versus late time-restricted feeding schedules.

- 00:55: Defining Early vs. Late Feeding Windows
    - 00:55: Early time-restricted feeding: Eating between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
    - 00:55: Late time-restricted feeding: Consuming meals from afternoon until 8:00 p.m.

- 01:21: Meta-Analysis: Overall Findings
    - 01:21: The meta-analysis revealed a reduction in HbA1c levels [AI KNOWLEDGE]({}), a measure of long-term blood sugar.
    - 01:21: Fasting glucose and fasting insulin didn't show significant changes overall.
    - 01:21: This supports the idea that time-restricted eating can help manage calorie intake and improve HbA1c.

- 01:52: Subgroup Analysis: Early vs. Late Feeding
    - 01:52: Early time-restricted feeding demonstrated more promising results in lowering fasting blood glucose.
    - 01:52: It also showed a slight advantage in reducing fasting blood insulin levels.

- 01:52: Questioning Long-Term Significance
    - 01:52: Is there a lasting impact from these early vs. late time-restricted feeding differences?
    - 02:19: HbA1c data did not show a statistically significant difference between the two feeding windows.

- 02:19: The Importance of HbA1c Measurement
    - 02:19: HbA1c provides a view of average blood glucose levels over roughly 120 days.
    - 02:19: It serves as a reliable indicator of long-term blood glucose management.

- 02:48: Explaining Fasting Glucose Variations
    - 02:48: Lower fasting glucose with early time-restricted feeding might be due to a longer fasting duration before measurement.
    - 03:18: Future studies should standardize measurement timing to account for these varying fasting periods.

- 03:47: Standardizing Glucose Measurements
    - 03:18: Measure glucose at comparable fasting durations for both early and late time-restricted feeding groups.
    - 04:15: Under similar postabsorptive conditions, blood glucose levels might show less divergence.

- 04:15: Hypothesis: Blood Glucose Fluctuations
    - 04:15: Late in the day, those on late time-restricted feeding might exhibit lower blood glucose compared to the early group.
    - 04:15: This is because the early time-restricted feeding group would have already consumed their meals for the day.

- 04:39: Key Takeaway: Prioritize Adherence
    - 04:39: Time-restricted feeding is an effective strategy for calorie management.

    - 00:55: Early time-restricted feeding: Eating between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
    - 00:55: Late time-restricted feeding: Consuming meals from afternoon until 8:00 p.m.

- 01:21: Meta-Analysis: Overall Findings
    - 01:21: The meta-analysis revealed a reduction in HbA1c levels [AI KNOWLEDGE]({}), a measure of long-term blood sugar.
    - 01:21: Fasting glucose and fasting insulin didn't show significant changes overall.
    - 01:21: This supports the idea that time-restricted eating can help manage calorie intake and improve HbA1c.

- 01:52: Subgroup Analysis: Early vs. Late Feeding
    - 01:52: Early time-restricted feeding demonstrated more promising results in lowering fasting blood glucose.
    - 01:52: It also showed a slight advantage in reducing fasting blood insulin levels.

- 01:52: Questioning Long-Term Significance
    - 01:52: Is there a lasting impact from these early vs. late time-restricted feeding differences?
    - 02:19: HbA1c data did not show a statistically significant difference between the two feeding windows.

- 02:19: The Importance of HbA1c Measurement
    - 02:19: HbA1c provides a view of average blood glucose levels over roughly 120 days.
    - 02:19: It serves as a reliable indicator of long-term blood glucose management.

- 02:48: Explaining Fasting Glucose Variations
    - 02:48: Lower fasting glucose with early time-restricted feeding might be due to a longer fasting duration before measurement.
    - 03:18: Future studies should standardize measurement timing to account for these varying fasting periods.

- 03:47: Standardizing Glucose Measurements
    - 03:18: Measure glucose at comparable fasting durations for both early and late time-restricted feeding groups.
    - 04:15: Under similar postabsorptive conditions, blood glucose levels might show less divergence.

- 04:15: Hypothesis: Blood Glucose Fluctuations
    - 04:15: Late in the day, those on late time-restricted feeding might exhibit lower blood glucose compared to the early group.
    - 04:15: This is because the early time-restricted feeding group would have already consumed their meals for the day.

- 04:39: Key Takeaway: Prioritize Adherence

    - 00:00: Diving into a new meta-analysis exploring time-restricted eating.
    - 00:00: Examining its impact on key markers: HbA1c, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose levels.

- 00:30: Time-Restricted Eating: The Study Design
    - 00:30: Comparing time-restricted eating to control diets, without calorie matching.
    - 00:30: Investigating the effects of early versus late time-restricted feeding schedules.

- 00:55: Defining Early vs. Late Feeding Windows
    - 00:55: Early time-restricted feeding: Eating between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
    - 00:55: Late time-restricted feeding: Consuming meals from afternoon until 8:00 p.m.

- 01:21: Meta-Analysis: Overall Findings
    - 01:21: The meta-analysis revealed a reduction in HbA1c levels [AI KNOWLEDGE]({}), a measure of long-term blood sugar.
    - 01:21: Fasting glucose and fasting insulin didn't show significant changes overall.
    - 01:21: This supports the idea that time-restricted eating can help manage calorie intake and improve HbA1c.

- 01:52: Subgroup Analysis: Early vs. Late Feeding
    - 01:52: Early time-restricted feeding demonstrated more promising results in lowering fasting blood glucose.
    - 01:52: It also showed a slight advantage in reducing fasting blood insulin levels.

- 01:52: Questioning Long-Term Significance
    - 01:52: Is there a lasting impact from these early vs. late time-restricted feeding differences?
    - 02:19: HbA1c data did not show a statistically significant difference between the two feeding windows.

- 02:19: The Importance of HbA1c Measurement
    - 02:19: HbA1c provides a view of average blood glucose levels over roughly 120 days.
    - 02:19: It serves as a reliable indicator of long-term blood glucose management.

- 02:48: Explaining Fasting Glucose Variations
    - 02:48: Lower fasting glucose with early time-restricted feeding might be due to a longer fasting duration before measurement.
    - 03:18: Future studies should standardize measurement timing to account for these varying fasting periods.

- 03:47: Standardizing Glucose Measurements
    - 03:18: Measure glucose at comparable fasting durations for both early and late time-restricted feeding groups.
    - 04:15: Under similar postabsorptive conditions, blood glucose levels might show less divergence.

- 04:15: Hypothesis: Blood Glucose Fluctuations
    - 04:15: Late in the day, those on late time-restricted feeding might exhibit lower blood glucose compared to the early group.
    - 04:15: This is because the early time-restricted feeding group would have already consumed their meals for the day.

- 04:39: Key Takeaway: Prioritize Adherence
    - 04:39: Time-restricted feeding is an effective strategy for calorie management.

- 02:48: Explaining Fasting Glucose Variations
    - 02:48: Lower fasting glucose with early time-restricted feeding might be due to a longer fasting duration before measurement.
    - 03:18: Future studies should standardize measurement timing to account for these varying fasting periods.

- 03:47: Standardizing Glucose Measurements
    - 03:18: Measure glucose at comparable fasting durations for both early and late time-restricted feeding groups.
    - 04:15: Under similar postabsorptive conditions, blood glucose levels might show less divergence.

- 04:15: Hypothesis: Blood Glucose Fluctuations
    - 04:15: Late in the day, those on late time-restricted feeding might exhibit lower blood glucose compared to the early group.
    - 04:15: This is because the early time-restricted feeding group would have already consumed their meals for the day.

- 04:39: Key Takeaway: Prioritize Adherence
