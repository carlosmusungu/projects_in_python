### Explanation:
'''
pyautogui.scroll()`**: This function simulates the scroll wheel. A negative value scrolls **down**, while a positive value scrolls **up**.
- **`time.sleep()`**: The `sleep` function is used to give you time to focus on the browser window before the script starts.

### **Notes**:
- **Coordinate-Based Scrolling**: PyAutoGUI works by simulating mouse events. If you want more controlled scrolling (e.g., making the browser scroll exactly to a certain point), you can combine mouse movement with the `scroll` function.
- **Browser Window Focus**: Make sure that the browser window is in focus when the script runs. Otherwise, the scrolling will happen wherever the mouse cursor is currently located.

### Example: Scrolling Multiple Times

```python
'''
import pyautogui
import time
import keyboard

# Give time to focus on the browser
time.sleep(2)

#pyautogui.moveTo(4033, 500) use this code to move to specific set of coordinates to do the scrolling

# Scroll down multiple times
def scroll():
    x = int(input("Enter the scroll range (~ 400 is ideal)"))
    for _ in range(x):  # Scroll 5 times
        pyautogui.scroll(-250)  # Scroll downwards
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Pause between scrolls
        print(_)



scroll()
keyboard.wait('esc')
