It's impossible to diagnose your condition online.  **You should see a doctor or other healthcare professional as soon as possible.**\n",

       "* **The flu or another viral infection:** These often present with a combination of aches, pains, and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n",
       "* **Food poisoning:**  This can cause stomach aches, headaches, and sometimes body aches.\n",
       "* **Food allergies or intolerances:**  While less likely to cause joint pain, severe reactions can trigger a range of symptoms.\n",
       "* **Autoimmune diseases:** Conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can cause widespread pain and inflammation.\n",
       "* **Infections:**  More serious infections can cause systemic symptoms, affecting multiple organ systems.\n",
       "* **Stress:**  Stress can manifest physically in various ways, including headaches and stomach issues.  While less likely to directly cause joint pain, it can exacerbate existing conditions.\n",

A healthcare provider can perform a proper examination, order tests (like blood work) if necessary, and provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.  Delaying medical attention could potentially worsen your condition.\n"
